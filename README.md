# Musical-Paint

School project. Created a digital canvas for music composition. 
Shapes on the canvas are translated to sounds of different instruments and create a musical sequence. 
I focused on making music creation easy, intuitive and beautiful. 

With a wide variety of instruments, shapes and colors, I believe that the ability to visually create a work of art will stimulate creativity, thus enriching the music created as a result of drawing. 

Technical summary:
Coded using Java and the jmusic library.
The app will include different musical instruments: Drum kit, piano, bass, harp, saxophone.
Each instrument will be represented by a different shape.
The X axis on the screen represents the time.
The Y axis represents the note.
The length of the shape impacts the duration of the note.
The transparency of the shape affects the amplitude of the note.
